# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to observe the Outcome of Kickstarter Campaigns from the Launch Date and Funding Goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To begin this analysis, a pivot table of the kickstarter data was created and filtered for only theater projects. Since the goal was to analyze Launch Date vs. Outcome, months were placed in the rows and outcomes were placed in the columns. Finally, a pivot chart was created to plot the theater outcomes of interest (successful, failed, cancelled) based on launch date, as shown below. The months with the most successful theater outcomes appear to be May and June.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
